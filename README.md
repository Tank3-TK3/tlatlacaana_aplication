## SUMMARY
The project presented here seeks to be a friendly tool with the trained user, capable of doing IP and port recognition. In the recognition phase of a computer security audit, we find very useful and powerful tools, but not very friendly, that is why our project focuses on bringing a useful and easy-to-use tool kit for the user as well as having an interface in which all the tools and information obtained will be displayed.

This software will have 7 main functionalities:
 1. DNS to IP
 2. Test Connection
 3. Trace Connection
 4. Inquire IP
 5. Check Port
 6. Port Finder
 7. Get Banner
